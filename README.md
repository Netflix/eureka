Eureka

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Netflix/eureka.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Netflix/eureka)

Eureka is a REST (Representational State Transfer) based service that is primarily used in the AWS cloud for locating services for the purpose of load balancing and failover of middle-tier servers.

At Netflix, Eureka is used for the following purposes apart from playing a critical part in mid-tier load balancing.

* For aiding Netflix Asgard - an open source service which makes cloud deployments easier, in  
    + Fast rollback of versions in case of problems avoiding the re-launch of 100's of instances which 
      could take a long time.
    + In rolling pushes, for avoiding propagation of a new version to all instances in case of problems.

* For our cassandra deployments to take instances out of traffic for maintenance.

* For our memcached caching services to identify the list of nodes in the ring.

* For carrying other additional application specific metadata about services for various other reasons.
